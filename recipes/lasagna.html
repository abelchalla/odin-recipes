    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Lasagna is a classic Italian dish that consists of layers of flat pasta sheets, meat or vegetable filling, and a rich tomato sauce, all topped with melted cheese. The dish is known for its hearty and comforting nature and has become a staple in many households around the world.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Cheese Filling: For this classic lasagna recipe, the filling contains ricotta and parmesan with seasonings and a couple of tablespoons of parsley. No ricotta? No problem, cottage cheese works just fine in this recipe!
        </li>
        <li>Meat: I use both Italian sausage and ground beef for great flavor. If using all beef, add a ¼ teaspoon of fennel seeds and some Italian seasoning to the meat mixture for flavor.</li>
        <li>Sauce: To keep this sauce quick, I use pasta sauce or marinara sauce (it’s easy to make from scratch with crushed tomatoes and canned tomatoes if you’d prefer).</li>
        <li>Spinach (variation): To make a spinach lasagna, squeeze out most of the moisture of defrosted frozen spinach and add it along with the cheese layer.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil pasta: Cook in a large pot of salted water per the recipe below.</li>
        <li>Prepare meat sauce: Cook sausage and beef with onion and garlic. Drain well, add the pasta sauce & simmer it for a few minutes to thicken.</li>
        <li>Combine cheese mixture: Stir the cheese mixture together in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Layer & bake: Layer the meat sauce and cheese mixture with lasagna noodles and bake until browned and bubbly.</li>
    </ol>
